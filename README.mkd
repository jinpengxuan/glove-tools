Notes
---------

When using the 5Dt Glove, make a folder in the root installation
location of the 5DT software called "SDK".  Download the Windows
32/64bit driver zip file from [5DT](http://www.5dt.com/?page_id=34).
Then, copy the contents of the zip to the SDK folder.  This allows
CMake to appropriately find the includes and libraries without
having to manually specify location of GLOVE5DT_ROOT_DIR.
